To run the notebook and load the dataset, follow the below instructions - 

1. Download the dataset from - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset

2. keep all the files provided and the downloaded dataset in either the current working directory, or change the working directory to any path you like in the Jupyter Notebook. 

3. Open 'Data Preparation_Reverse_Encode.ipynb' and run it to prepare the dataset for EDA. 

4. Open 'Forest_Cover_Type_Prediction_ADS.ipynb' notebook and run it keep the same working directory where the files are. This is the main Notebook for the Assignment.

5. You will find all the steps from Data Analysis to feature Selection to Predictive Modeling for classification of Cover type. 

6. If you want to look at the rest Experiments too, you can open 'Forest_Cover_Type_Experiments_Outliers.ipynb' and run it. In this i have removed the Outliers and did predictive modeling without feature scaling.
