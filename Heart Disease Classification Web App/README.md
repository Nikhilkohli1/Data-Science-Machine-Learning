### Problem Definition
Given clinical parameters about a person, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

### Dataset - 
The dataset used for this is UCI Heart Diseases Dataset also avaiable at Kaggle. 

***Based on the extensive feature selection and looking at all aspects of Training accuracy, Testing Accuracy, Precision & Recall, SVM & Logistic Regression is the best estimator.I got a Test accuracy of 88.52% and f1 score of 89% on both. ***

Max heart rate, Exercise induced Angina, Chest pain type and Major vessel counts seems to be most significant for Prediction of Heart Diseases.

I have developed a ***Inference pipeline too and deployed the Model as a service using Streamlit & Docker***.
